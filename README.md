# [CVPR 2024] Dynamic Graph Representation with Knowledge-aware Attention for Histopathology Whole Slide Image Analysis
## 1. Introduction
### WiKG: *Whole Slide Image is a **K**nowledge Graph*

![Example Image](images/example.png "Example Image")

We demonstrate a novel whole slide image (WSI) analysis method based on graph representation called *WiKG*, which represents a WSI as a knowledge graph, cropped patches as graph nodes, and uses the head-to-tail embedding of patches to generate dynamic graph representations. 

### 2. For Model Code
This repository is based on the Pytorch version of the WiKG code. 

The model code and train demo code have been released, and we will add more details soon.

### 3. For Preprint Paper
Our articles will be released in *Arxiv* first.
